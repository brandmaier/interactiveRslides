Here is a little demo that show how with only few lines of code we can
combine the IOSlides presentation framework and Shiny to create
presentations, in which we can online evaluate R code. This seems
particularly useful for teaching because there is no need to switch to an R
interpreter during a presentation. Here is how your presentation with an
interactive R input box may look:
