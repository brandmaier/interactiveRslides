IOSlides + Shiny = interactive R code in presentations
=======

What is this?
-------------

Here is a little demo that demonstrates how -- with only few lines of code
-- we can combine the IOSlides presentation framework and Shiny to create
presentations, in R code can be entered and evaluated in your presentation
slides. This seems particularly useful for teaching because there is no need to switch to an
 R session during a presentation. Here is how your presentation with an
interactive R input box may look:

Usage
------------
Download the repository, open the `Ã¬nteractiveRslides.Rmd` in RStudio and hit the 'Run
Presentation' button.

Then, go to slide 3 and enter some R code into the textbox. If all goes
well, the return value of the evaluated expression will be output to the slide.
