IOSlides + Shiny = interactive R slides
=======

What is this?
-------------

Here is a little demo that show how with only few lines of code we can
combine the IOSlides presentation framework and Shiny to create
presentations, in which we can online evaluate R code. This seems
particularly useful for teaching because there is no need to switch to an R
interpreter during a presentation.

Usage
------------
Download the repository, open the project in RStudio and hit the 'Run
Presentation' button.
